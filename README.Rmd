# Overview of drawProteins
This package has been created to allow the creation of protein schematics based on the data obtained from the [Uniprot Protein Database](http://www.uniprot.org/). 

## The basic workflow is:
<li> to provide one or more Uniprot IDs
<li> get a list of feature from the Uniprot API
<li> draw the basic chains of these proteins
<li> add features as desired

drawProteins uses the package httr to interact with the Uniprot API and extract a JSON object into R. The JSON object is used to create a data.table. 

The graphing package ggplot2 is then used to create the protein schematic. 

The package works best when pipes %>% provided by the magrittr package are also used. 

The Vignette gives a good overview of the package.
