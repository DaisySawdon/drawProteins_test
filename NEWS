CHANGES IN VERSION 0.98.3
-----------------------

FEATURES

    o New function called draw_canvas. This function was previously within
    draw_chains but has now been pulled out to allow the generation of a canvas
    separately from the chains. It did require quite a rewrite but I think
    it will make things more useful For example, it will allow the plotting of
    domains without chains which has the potential to be very useful.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.98.2
-----------------------

FEATURES

    o Rename functions from geom to draw. E.g geom_chains is now geom_draw.
    This is because they weren't really geoms and using the word draw seem
    more helpful and a better reflection of the function.
